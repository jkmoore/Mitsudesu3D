# Mitsudesu3D
Mitsudesu3D is an augmented reality arcade-style action game for iOS. It is inspired by [密ですゲーム (Mitsudesu Game)](https://gamingchahan.com/mitsudesu/) created by Japanese developer 群青ちきん. I developed Mitsudesu3D in Unity with the Vuforia Engine.<br>
<br>
In Mitsudesu3D, you use your device's camera to find and eliminate incoming enemies while collecting items that appear all around you in 3D space. The main goal is to eliminate as many enemies as possible to accumulate your score. Enjoy a wide range of sound effects from the original game (plus new photorealistic graphics) while looking like an idiot spinning around frantically tapping your phone.<br>
